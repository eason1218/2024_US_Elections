# Forecasting US Presidential Election Results Using Bayesian Prediction

## Overview

This repo explores predicting US presidential election outcomes using Bayesian methods, improving accuracy by aggregating poll data and incorporating prior information. The model shows Trump leading with 35.52% support, followed by Biden at 28.90%, despite Biden's withdrawal. The study emphasizes the importance of using up-to-date data and acknowledges limitations, such as potential biases and outdated information in polling data.
