# Forecasting US Presidential Election Results Using Bayesian Prediction

## Overview

This project explores predicting US presidential election outcomes using Bayesian methods, improving accuracy by aggregating poll data and incorporating prior information. The model shows Trump leading with 35.52% support, followed by Biden at 28.90%, despite Biden's withdrawal. The study emphasizes the importance of using up-to-date data and acknowledges limitations, such as potential biases and outdated information in polling data.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from FiveThirtyEight_Polls.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains about literature, LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, test and model data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Some coding and editing writing in this paper is done with the help of ChatGPT 4o and the entire chat history is available in usage.txt located in the "llm" folder under the "other" folder.
